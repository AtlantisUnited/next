# NextJS Custom Workshop

This is a bunch of workups you may use to set up your __NextJS__ app really quickly and comfortable

#Installation

First of all, choose the package that matches your requirements

Then do the following:

`npm install @atlantis-lab/[package-name]`

Or with yarn:

`yarn add @atlantis-lab/[package-name]`

If you are not sure about command you are going to execute to install the right package - just go to the `README.md` file in your package's directory and copy the script from there
